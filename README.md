# Welcome Contoso BI - Analytics Demo Assets for Dynamics 365 Sellers

These demo assets are designed to help demonstrate the power of using Power BI analytics and reporting to expose the value of the data in a Dynamics 365 CE implementation. 

There are two approaches you can choose from - One version connects directly to the data in Dataverse, -the other has sample data which originated from Dynamics 365 Sales, but for maximum demo flexibility it is stored in Excel allowing easy reconfiguration and redeployment.
